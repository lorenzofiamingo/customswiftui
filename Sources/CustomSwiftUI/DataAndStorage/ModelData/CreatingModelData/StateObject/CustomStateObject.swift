import Combine

/// A property wrapper type that instantiates an observable object.
///
/// Use a state object as the single source of truth for a reference type that
/// you store in a view hierarchy. Create a state object in an ``App``,
/// ``Scene``, or ``View`` by applying the `@StateObject` attribute to a
/// property declaration and providing an initial value that conforms to the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Combine/ObservableObject>
/// protocol. Declare state objects as private to prevent setting them from a
/// memberwise initializer, which can conflict with the storage management that
/// SwiftUI provides:
///
///     class DataModel: ObservableObject {
///         @Published var name = "Some Name"
///         @Published var isEnabled = false
///     }
///
///     struct MyView: View {
///         @StateObject private var model = DataModel() // Create the state object.
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text(model.name) // Updates when the data model changes.
///             MySubView()
///                 .environmentObject(model)
///         }
///     }
///
/// SwiftUI creates a new instance of the model object only once during the
/// lifetime of the container that declares the state object. For example,
/// SwiftUI doesn't create a new instance if a view's inputs change, but does
/// create a new instance if the identity of a view changes. When published
/// properties of the observable object change, SwiftUI updates any view that
/// depends on those properties, like the ``Text`` view in the above example.
///
/// > Note: If you need to store a value type, like a structure, string, or
///   integer, use the ``State`` property wrapper instead. Also use ``State``
///   if you need to store a reference type that conforms to the
///   <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable()>
///   protocol. To learn more about Observation in SwiftUI, see
///   <doc:Managing-model-data-in-your-app>.
///
/// ### Share state objects with subviews
///
/// You can pass a state object into a subview through a property that has the
/// ``ObservedObject`` attribute. Alternatively, add the object to the
/// environment of a view hierarchy by applying the
/// ``View/environmentObject(_:)`` modifier to a view, like `MySubView` in the
/// above code. You can then read the object inside `MySubView` or any of its
/// descendants using the ``EnvironmentObject`` attribute:
///
///     struct MySubView: View {
///         @EnvironmentObject var model: DataModel
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $model.isEnabled)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Get a ``Binding`` to the state object's properties using the dollar sign
/// (`$`) operator. Use a binding when you want to create a two-way connection.
/// In the above code, the ``Toggle`` controls the model's `isEnabled` value
/// through a binding.
///
/// ### Initialize state objects using external data
///
/// When a state object's initial state depends on data that comes from
/// outside its container, you can call the object's initializer
/// explicitly from within its container's initializer. For example,
/// suppose the data model from the previous example takes a `name`
/// input during initialization and you want to use a value for that
/// name that comes from outside the view. You can do this with
/// a call to the state object's initializer inside an explicit initializer
/// that you create for the view:
///
///     struct MyInitializableView: View {
///         @StateObject private var model: DataModel
///
///         init(name: String) {
///             // SwiftUI ensures that the following initialization uses the
///             // closure only once during the lifetime of the view, so
///             // later changes to the view's name input have no effect.
///             _model = StateObject(wrappedValue: DataModel(name: name))
///         }
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Name: \(model.name)")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Use caution when doing this. SwiftUI only initializes a state object
/// the first time you call its initializer in a given view. This
/// ensures that the object provides stable storage even as the view's
/// inputs change. However, it might result in unexpected behavior or
/// unwanted side effects if you explicitly initialize the state object.
///
/// In the above example, if the `name` input to `MyInitializableView`
/// changes, SwiftUI reruns the view's initializer with the new value. However,
/// SwiftUI runs the autoclosure that you provide to the state object's
/// initializer only the first time you call the state object's initializer, so
/// the model's stored `name` value doesn't change.
///
/// Explicit state object initialization works well when the external data
/// that the object depends on doesn't change for a given instance of the
/// object's container. For example, you can create two views with different
/// constant names:
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             MyInitializableView(name: "Ravi")
///             MyInitializableView(name: "Maria")
///         }
///     }
///
/// > Important: Even for a configurable state object, you still declare it
///   as private. This ensures that you can't accidentally set the parameter
///   through a memberwise initializer of the view, because doing so can
///   conflict with the framework's storage management and produce unexpected
///   results.
///
/// ### Force reinitialization by changing view identity
///
/// If you want SwiftUI to reinitialize a state object when a view input
/// changes, make sure that the view's identity changes at the same time.
/// One way to do this is to bind the view's identity to the value that changes
/// using the ``View/id(_:)`` modifier. For example, you can ensure that
/// the identity of an instance of `MyInitializableView` changes when its
/// `name` input changes:
///
///     MyInitializableView(name: name)
///         .id(name) // Binds the identity of the view to the name property.
///
/// > NOTE: If your view appears inside a ``ForEach``, it implicitly receives an
///   ``View/id(_:)`` modifier that uses the identifier of the corresponding
///   data element.
///
/// If you need the view to reinitialize state based on changes in more than
/// one value, you can combine the values into a single identifier using a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Hasher>. For example,
/// if you want to update the data model in `MyInitializableView` when the
/// values of either `name` or `isEnabled` change, you can combine both
/// variables into a single hash:
///
///     var hash: Int {
///         var hasher = Hasher()
///         hasher.combine(name)
///         hasher.combine(isEnabled)
///         return hasher.finalize()
///     }
///
/// Then apply the combined hash to the view as an identifier:
///
///     MyInitializableView(name: name, isEnabled: isEnabled)
///         .id(hash)
///
/// Be mindful of the performance cost of reinitializing the state object every
/// time the input changes. Also, changing view identity can have side
/// effects. For example, SwiftUI doesn't automatically animate
/// changes inside the view if the view's identity changes at the same time.
/// Also, changing the identity resets _all_ state held by the view, including
/// values that you manage as ``State``, ``FocusState``, ``GestureState``,
/// and so on.
